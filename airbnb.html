                    <div class="airbnb-container">
                        <p>This study examines the economic capability of Europeans to afford accommodations within their own capitals, focusing on the disparities in purchasing power and accommodation costs across EU and EFTA countries. Utilizing data from Eurostat and Airbnb, we integrated economic indicators with real-time accommodation prices to provide a comprehensive analysis. The findings indicate a strong correlation between GDP per capita and accommodation prices, with wealthier countries generally exhibiting higher prices. Significant disparities were observed in the ability of citizens from different countries to afford domestic tourism, with Southern and Eastern European nations facing the greatest challenges.

I have honed my skills in Python, R, Power BI, and Google Looker Studio, allowing me to efficiently analyze and interpret complex data sets to drive informed decision-making. With a passion for transforming data into actionable insights, I am eager to contribute to a dynamic team and leverage my expertise to solve real-world problems and create value through data science.</p>
